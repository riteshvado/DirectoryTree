# DirectoryTree

The aim of the project is to build dictionary representation of directory structure in OS
The dictionary must also in include all sub dirs. 
*We are using dictionayr but we can use our won tree structure as well cause it may provide more flexibily of printing levels

One we have dictionary we want to print the structure  like tree command on windows.
